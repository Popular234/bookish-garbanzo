                Part 2 of JoJos Bizzare Adventure is probabably one of my favorite parts because it is the last part before the stands become a thing in the series. Part 2 uses Hamon as the power source instead of something that can only be seen by users of the same type of thing.

               Part 3 is the first part of JJBA introucing the stands, the stands hold immense power and will protect their user if threatened. Part 3 is one of the longer parts as Part 3 is actually split into 2 parts within itself and it turns out to be very good at times.
